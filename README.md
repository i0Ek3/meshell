Here are some scripts for personal use, these scripts are not fully tested, so be careful! 

> YOU OWN RISK!!!

## Getting Started

Some scripts can only work on Linux or macOS platform, and some scripts can work on both, just check folders.

Run command `sh filename.sh` to execute the scripts.

Run command `sh ./mac-dev.sh` to setting up macOS development environment.
